### Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot 
git clone https://github.com/BEE-Plugin/beeplugin-react-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Open config.local.ts and change  
# the placeholders with your credentials
CLIENT_ID:       '### my-client-id ###'
CLIENT_SECRET:   '### my-secret-key ###'
CLIENT_UID:      '### username ###'
# NOTE: remember to store these credentials in your
# back-end and not expose them publicly in your front-end

# Install dependencies, then start the project
#Â with the minimal scripts provided:
> npm install
> npm start

# or using yarn:
> yarn
> yarn start

# Then simply run it in your browser
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Build
There is a simple build script that uses Webpack default configuration for the bundle
```bash
# Build the project in a single artifact:
> npm run build

# or with yarn:
> yarn build
```
The output is a `bundle.js` file in the root of the project.
