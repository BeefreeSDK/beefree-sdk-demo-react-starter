### Prerequisites

- [FREE Developer Account](https://developers.beefree.io/signup/plan/1)


### Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone this repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot 
git clone https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-demo-react-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject
```

Open `config/config.local.ts` and change the placeholders with your credentials:
```javascript
CLIENT_ID:       '### my-client-id ###'
CLIENT_SECRET:   '### my-secret-key ###'
CLIENT_UID:      '### username ###'
```
> NOTE: remember to store these credentials in your
> back-end and not expose them publicly in your front-end

Install dependencies, then start the project
Â with the minimal scripts provided:

```bash
> npm install
> npm start

# or using yarn:
> yarn
> yarn start
```
Then run it in your browser:  
http://localhost:8080/


### Build
There is a simple build script that uses **Webpack** default configuration for the bundle
```bash
# Build the project in a single artifact:
> npm run build

# or with yarn:
> yarn build
```
The output is a `bundle.js` file in the project's root.
